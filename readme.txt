# machine-learning-classifier

Context - 
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Content- 
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.
Build a Machine Learning model to predict whether a person is having DIABETES or not based on certain diagnostic measurements present in dataset .
data source - www.kaggle.com , www.google.com.

used different CLASSIFIERS to build the model  and also applied parameter tuning and compared their accuracies.

used ANN(Artificial Neural Network)  to determine the probability  of a person having DIABETES.

LANGUAGE USED :- PYTHON .
